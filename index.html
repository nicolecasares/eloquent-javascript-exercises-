  <h1>Eloquent Javascript Loops</h1>
  <p>Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:<br>

  #<br>
  ##<br>
  ###<br>
  ####<br>
  #####<br>
  ######<br>
  #######</p>

  <p>for(i="#"; i.length <= 7; i+= "#"){<br>
 
  console.log(i); <br>
}</p>

<p>
  FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)
</p>

<p>for(i=1; i<= 100; i++){<br>
if(i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0){<br>
  console.log("FIZZBUZZ")<br>
}else if(i % 3 === 0){<br>
    console.log('FIZZ');<br>
  }else if(i % 5 === 0){<br>
    console.log('BUZZ');<br>
  }else{<br>
    console.log(i);<br>
  }
}</p>
